## Introduction

This is part 2 of the overall assignment set for this module.

In part 1 of the assignment we looked to UX research to find out what can be done to improve on the SOL page. The outcome of the research pointed to 2 directions.

1. User interaction
2. User organisation support

In point one a tool that is very useful is a forum. Yet this function was not made aware to the students, even as final year students this tool was not made aware to them. The reason for this was because this tool was well hidden in the maze of option provided on the nav bar.

In point 2 it was discovered that students, as users, have not developed in organisation and structure. A toll that would be created is a to-do list. As this is such a basic tool but mastering it can take years.

## Methodology

Based on what we found on part 1 of the assignment, having a deeper look at the type of methodology we concluded that the best approach is to use the agile method. Reason being the key principles of this method:
* Customer satisfaction: Delivering value to the customer is the primary goal.
* Iterative development: Projects are divided into smaller, manageable iterations, with each iteration delivering a working product incrementally.
* Adaptability: The project plan and deliverables can be adjusted as needed based on changing requirements or feedback.
* Continuous improvement: Teams regularly review and improve their processes and products to optimize efficiency and quality.

So the primary key benefit of the Agile methodology is its flexibility. Unlike traditional project management methods, which often involve rigid plans and schedules, Agile methodology allows for changes and adjustments to be made throughout the project. This is particularly useful in software development, where requirements can change rapidly as the project progresses.

One of the downsides of this methodology is that it becomes challenging when managing the scope of works (SOWs). Because Agile methodology allows for changes and adjustments to be made throughout the project, it can be difficult to manage the scope of the project and ensure that it stays within the agreed-upon parameters.

But this is best suited when working on core projects have been completed and are looking to methods of improvement. Such as this current assignment, were we have what can look like a very good and modern site so why improve it? or how or what to improve. Due to looking at the customer satifaction as a principle lots of surveys and questionaires are essential to understand if the user is satisfied.
