## Introduction

This is part 2 of the overall assignment set for this module.

In part 1 of the assignment we looked to UX research to find out what can be done to improve on the SOL page. The outcome of the research pointed to 2 directions.

1. User interaction
2. User organisation support

In point one a tool that is very useful is a forum. Yet this function was not made aware to the students, even as final year students this tool was not made aware to them. The reason for this was because this tool was well hidden in the maze of option provided on the nav bar.

In point 2 it was discovered that students, as users, have not developed in organisation and structure. A toll that would be created is a to-do list. As this is such a basic tool but mastering it can take years.
